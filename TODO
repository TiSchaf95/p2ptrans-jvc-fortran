P Comment functions with python headers
- Convergence criteria with gradient instead of distance
- Exact tmat volume correspondance
- p2ptrans + pathfinder: allways find an answer (could include exact tmat)
- Cleanup tolerances
- Create test suite, jarvis
- Implement GPU-Acceleration
- Reduce exploration space with symmetry

3D

X Simplify / Classify stdout in 3D code
X Streamline usgae as a python module
X Section functions in p2ptrans.py (create multiple python files)
- Clean useful program such as p2pcheck so that they can be used as easily as p2ptrans.py 
X pip install as a python module
X Install as a command line function
- Create a pylada-minimal that does not require full pylada install

2D

X Section functions in p2ptrans.py as in python3D code
X Merge 2D with 3D suh that there is p2pint.py (interfaces, 2D) and p2ptrans.py (transformation, 3D)
   The two programs should be using some of the same functions
X Modify setup.py accordingly
X Makes sure names are not changed when using supercell
X Remove duplicates in reconstructures as they are added
X Better folder management
- Automatic symmetry detection
